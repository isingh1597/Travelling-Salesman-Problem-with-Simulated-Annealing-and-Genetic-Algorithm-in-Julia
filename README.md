# Travelling-Salesman-Problem-with-Simulated-Annealing-and-Genetic-Algorithm-in-Julia 

This project aims to implement two optimization algorithms, Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithm on the Travelling Salesman Problem in Julia. The travelling salesman problem seeks to find the shortest route between cities such that each city in the route is covered once and the traveler returns to the starting point. Over the years, many exact methods and heuristics have been developed to solve this problem. In this project I focus on two of those heuristics, simulated annealing and the genetic algorithm.

The dataset 'eli51' contains 2D Euclidean X and Y integer coordinates of 51 points in the network. It is taken from a dataset within Christofedes and Eilon's work on the vehicle routing problem (1969).
